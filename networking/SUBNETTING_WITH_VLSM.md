## 📝 **Project Overview**
In this lab, I will use **Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)** to allocate IP addresses for hosts of varying sizes across four subnets. I will also configure static routes to enable inter-LAN communication between these subnets.

## 🎯 **Objectives**
- [ ] Subnet **192.168.5.0/24** network to provide sufficient addressing for each LAN  
- [ ] Assign the first usable address to the PC in each LAN  
- [ ] Assign the last usable address to the router's interface in each LAN
- [ ] Configure static routes on each router so that all PCs can ping each other
