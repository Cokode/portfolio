This lab was based on a task from Jeremy’s IT Lab on YouTube, and I want to give full credit to Jeremy for consistently creating some of the best free CCNA training resources available. His labs push you to think like a network engineer, not just memorize commands.



In this exercise, I:



Configured static 802.1Q trunks and disabled DTP negotiation



Built a structured VLAN IP plan using /26 subnets



Set up VTP Server, Client, and Transparent modes



Verified revision numbers, domain synchronization, and VLAN propagation



Tested behavior differences when adding VLANs in each VTP mode



Documented everything in a clean, professional format for my portfolio
