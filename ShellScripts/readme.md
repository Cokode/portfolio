This project provides a simple shell script that I've built to automates SSH access to my AWS Linux instances whose public IPv4 addresses change dynamically; after every reboot. 

this script is built to supports different EC2 instances connection, giving the flexibility to custom the hostname and remote public IP public IP.

The goal is to eliminate the repetitive steps of typing the whole strings of command each time I want to establish a remote connection. 

I've been learning shell scripting on my free time and I enjoy using it whenver/wherever I can.
